*chisel-zip*
The zip / zipWithIndex functions are used to create a list/sequence by "zipping"
the values up into a list/sequence of lists/sequences. You can see
that the output of iterating with a foreach loop over the zipped data 
shows that a, b, and c each are an element of each index. 

NOTE: zipWithIndex can be ran on a unique list/sequence to create a list 
of the elements with their index.

*chisel-map*
The map function takes an input list and allows you to create
another list by performing transforms on the input list. In the example
below you take the list and create a new list with the input sequence
times 2. As a result, the output list has the same number of elements
but with the integer values doubled.

    }

*chisel-learning*
 1. Use type aliasing when you want to avoid typing the same type: "type Foo = Seq[(UInt, String)]"
 2. A .map(...) statement on an Option[Seq[Any]] is the same as a None() / Some() match statement
 3. Use case classes instead of traits when users need to extend something to create a parameter list
 4. Option[Seq[...]] can be used but often accomplishes the same as just Seq[...] because you can just
    check if the Seq[...] is empty for the None() case. 
 5. Don't keep falling for the excessive if(...) cases. An empty array returns 0 so there's no need to return 0.
    `if (x.Empty) 0x0 else x * 0x8 == x * 0x8`
